üö¢ Deployment

**Frontend Deployment**
The live demo of this application is hosted on Vercel.
The frontend is a React application built with Create React App. To deploy it, you first need to build the static assets:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` folder containing the optimized static files.
These static files can then be deployed to any static site hosting provider such as Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, etc.

**Backend Deployment**
Specific deployment instructions for the FastAPI backend are not detailed in this README.
Common methods for deploying FastAPI applications include:
- Using Docker containers hosted on platforms like AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Instances.
- Deploying as serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions).
- Running on traditional servers or VMs using an ASGI server like Uvicorn with Gunicorn as a process manager.

üöÄ Future Improvements

User Authentication: Implement JWT-based auth system
Payment Integration: Add real payment processing
Advanced Filtering: Allow filtering by price, duration, etc.
Interactive Space Maps: Visual navigation of available destinations
VR Experience Previews: Virtual tours of accommodations
Localization: Support for multiple languages
Mobile Applications: Native apps for iOS and Android

üí≠ Development Journey
This project was developed through an iterative process, solving interesting challenges along the way:

Creating a multi-step booking flow with complex state management
Implementing a snake_case to camelCase converter for API responses
Building an immersive space-themed UI with dark mode
Developing a dynamic pricing engine that reflects various space travel options

The development process was guided by the need to create an intuitive, engaging interface for a futuristic concept while maintaining practical usability.
